## Simple Summary
Asset-backed offers is a proposal to resolve the issue that offers in the ledger might not be executable.

## Abstract
Asset-backed offers is a proposal to resolve the issue that a single account might have liabilities, in the form of offers on the ledger, that exceeds the assets of the account. When this occurs offers in the ledger might not be executable, in the sense that there exists no crossing offer such that the entire amount of the offer is exchanged. Offers in the ledger that are not executable provide a false sense of liquidity.

## Motivation
We will say that an offer is "immediately executable in full" (IEIF in short) if, were it crossed by a hypothetical offer with no limits on amount bought or sold, the entire amount of selling asset would be exchanged. It is desirable that all offers are IEIF since this enables users to easily evaluate the amount of available liquidity.

The protocol requires that, upon creation, every offer satisfies the following two conditions:

* The amount offered to sell does not exceed the available balance of the selling asset
* The amount offered to buy (computed implicitly) does not exceed the available limit of the buying asset

We will now demonstrate that these conditions are not sufficient to ensure that an offer is IEIF. Suppose that an account creates an offer which is IEIF with the selling amount equal to the available balance of the selling asset. The account then creates a second offer with a worse price but otherwise identical to the first. Although each offer individually satisfies the above requirements, the second offer is not IEIF. For suppose that the second offer was crossed by a hypothetical offer with no limits. This crossing offer would initially cross the first offer, which leaves no available balance for the selling asset. When the second offer is then crossed, no assets can be exchanged.

Analogous to the above example, it is possible to create multiple offers that individually meet the requirements but exceed the available limit when considered in aggregate. Suppose that an offer creates an offer which is IEIF with the buying amount equal to the available limit of the buying asset. The account then creates a second offer with a worse price but otherwise identical to the first. Although each offer individually satisfies the above requirements, the second offer is not IEIF. For suppose that the second offer was crossed by a hypothetical offer with no limits. This crossing offer would initially cross the first offer, which leaves no available limit for the buying asset. When the second offer is then crossed, no assets can be exchanged.

## Specification
This proposal will require a schema update for the accounts and trustlines tables. However, no corresponding changes are required in XDR for `AccountEntry` and `TrustLineEntry` as the new data is derived purely from other data in the ledger.
```sql
ALTER TABLE accounts ADD buyingliabilities BIGINT
    CHECK (buyingliabilities >= 0);
ALTER TABLE accounts ADD sellingliabilities BIGINT
    CHECK (sellingliabilities >= 0);
ALTER TABLE trustlines ADD buyingliabilities BIGINT
    CHECK (buyingliabilities >= 0);
ALTER TABLE trustlines ADD sellingliabilities BIGINT
    CHECK (sellingliabilities >= 0);
```

## Rationale
The purpose of the asset-backed offers proposal is to maintain the invariant that every offer is IEIF. We begin with a discussion of what can cause offers to no longer be IEIF:

* Fees
    * Account `A` is used to pay fees: offers owned by `A` and selling the native asset may no longer be IEIF
* `AllowTrustOp`
    * Revoke authorization from account `A` to hold non-native asset `X`: all offers owned by `A` and either buying or selling `X` are no longer IEIF
* `ChangeTrustOp`
    * Create trust line for account `A`: offers owned by `A` and selling the native asset may no longer be IEIF
    * Reduce the limit on a trust line for account `A` to hold a non-native asset `X`: offers owned by `A` and buying `X` may no longer be IEIF
* `CreateAccountOp`
    * Create account using native assets from account `A`: offers owned by `A` and selling the native asset may no longer be IEIF
* `ManageDataOp`
    * Create account data for account `A`: offers owned by `A` and selling the native asset may no longer be IEIF
* `ManageOfferOp` (and `CreatePassiveOfferOp`)
    * Account `A` crosses offer owned by account `M` selling asset `Y` for asset `X`:
        * offers owned by `A` and selling `X` may no longer be IEIF
        * offers owned by `A` and buying `Y` may no longer be IEIF
        * offers owned by `M` and selling `Y` may no longer be IEIF
        * offers owned by `M` and buying `X` may no longer be IEIF
    * Create offer for account `A` selling asset `X` for asset `Y`:
        * offers owned by `A` and selling `X` may no longer be IEIF
        * offers owned by `A` and buying `Y` may no longer be IEIF
        * offers owned by `A` and selling the native asset may no longer be IEIF
* `PaymentOp`
    * Account `S` pays asset `X` to account `D`:
        * offers owned by `S` and selling `X` may no longer be IEIF
        * offers owned by `D` and buying `X` may no longer be IEIF
* `PathPaymentOp`
    * Account `S` crosses offer owned by account `M` selling asset `Y` for asset `X`:
        * offers owned by `S` and selling `X` may no longer be IEIF
        * offers owned by `S` and buying `Y` may no longer be IEIF
        * offers owned by `M` and selling `Y` may no longer be IEIF
        * offers owned by `M` and buying `X` may no longer be IEIF
    * Account `S` pays asset `X` to account `D` arriving as asset `Y`:
        * offers owned by `S` and selling `X` may no longer be IEIF
        * offers owned by `D` and buying `Y` may no longer be IEIF
* `SetOptionsOp`
    * Add signer to account `A`: offers owned by `A` and selling the native asset may no longer be IEIF

From this analysis, it is clear that any proposal which attempts to modify or delete offers that are no longer IEIF would require maintaining the offer book after fee collection and after each operation. This would be both complicated and inefficient. Instead, we pursue a proposal which modifies the operations such that they guarantee offers remain IEIF. To achieve this, we first define new quantities which are derived data on the ledger:

* `account.sellingLiabilities`
    * For account `A`: the amount of native asset offered to be sold, aggregated over all offers owned by `A`
* `account.buyingLiabilities`
    * For account `A`: the amount of native asset offered to be bought, aggregated over all offers owned by `A`
* `trustline.sellingLiabilities`
    * For account `A` and non-native asset `X`: the amount of `X` offered to be sold, aggregated over all offers owned by `A`
* `trustline.buyingLiabilities`
    * For account `A` and non-native asset `X`: the amount of `X` offered to be bought, aggregated over all offers owned by `A`

These quantities will be updated whenever an offer is created, modified, or deleted. When an offer is created, the liabilities for the offer will be calculated and added to `buyingLiabilities` and `sellingLiabilities` in the relevant account and/or trust lines. When an offer is deleted, the liabilities for the offer will be calculated and subtracted from `buyingLiabilities` and `sellingLiabilities` in the relevant account and/or trust lines. When an offer is modified, it can be viewed as a delete followed by a create so the `buyingLiabilities` and `sellingLiabilities` can be updated using the logic from those cases. As we already load accounts and trust lines when interacting with offers, the cost of maintaining these quantities should be minimal.

We will now use these quantities to modify the operations such that they guarantee offers remain IEIF. In what follows, available limit is `INT64_MAX` for the native asset and `limit - buyingLiabilities` for non-native assets. Similarly, available balance is `balance - reserve - sellingLiabilities` for the native asset and `balance - sellingLiabilities` for non-native assets. In order for issuers to be able to buy or sell any quantity (even exceeding `INT64_MAX`) of an asset they issued, available limit and available balance will always be `INT64_MAX` in this case. The asset-backed offers proposal modifies the operations such that all offers remain IEIF after an operation:

* Fees
    * Account `A` is used to pay fees: transaction is not valid with result `txINSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` if new available balance of native asset is negative
* `AllowTrustOp`
    * Revoke authorization from account `A` to hold non-native asset `X`: all offers owned by `A` and either buying or selling `X` are deleted
* `ChangeTrustOp`
    * Create trust line for account `A`: fails with result `CHANGE_TRUST_LOW_RESERVE` if new available balance of native asset is negative
    * Reduce the limit on a trust line for account `A` to hold a non-native asset `X`: fails with result `CHANGE_TRUST_INVALID_LIMIT` if new available limit is negative
* `CreateAccountOp`
    * Create account using native assets from account `A`: fails with `CREATE_ACCOUNT_UNDERFUNDED` if new available balance of native asset is negative
* `ManageDataOp`
    * Create account data for account `A`: fails with result `MANAGE_DATA_LOW_RESERVE` if new available balance of native asset is negative
* `ManageOfferOp` (and `CreatePassiveOfferOp`)
    * Account `A` crosses offer owned by account `M` selling asset `Y` for asset `X`:
        * `A` does not buy more `Y` than available limit
        * `A` does not sell more `X` than available balance
        * `M` does not buy more `X` than available limit
        * `M` does not sell more `Y` than available balance
    * Create offer for account `A` selling asset `X` for asset `Y`:
        * `A` does not offer to sell more `X` than available balance
        * `A` does not offer to buy more `Y` than available limit
        * fails with result `MANAGE_OFFER_LOW_RESERVE` if new available balance of native asset is negative
* `PaymentOp`
    * Account `S` pays asset `X` to account `D`:
        * fails with result `PAYMENT_UNDERFUNDED` if new available balance of `X` in `S` is negative
        * fails with result `PAYMENT_LINE_FULL` if new available limit of `X` in `D` is negative
* `PathPaymentOp`
    * Account `S` pays asset `X` to account `D` arriving as asset `Y`:
        * fails with result `PATH_PAYMENT_UNDERFUNDED` if new available balance of `X` in `S` is negative
        * fails with result `PATH_PAYMENT_LINE_FULL` if new available limit of `Y` in `D` is negative
    * Account `S` crosses offer owned by account `M` selling asset `Y` for asset `X`:
        * `S` does not buy more `Y` than available limit
        * `S` does not sell more `X` than available balance
        * `M` does not buy more `X` than available limit
        * `M` does not sell more `Y` than available balance
* `SetOptionsOp`
    * Add signer to account `A`: fails with result `SET_OPTIONS_LOW_RESERVE` if new available balance of native asset is negative

## Backwards Compatibility
We will denote the protocol version which enables this proposal as `PROPOSAL_VERSION`. The database schema can be updated to include `buyingLiabilities` and `sellingLiabilities`, where these values are set to `NULL` until the protocol version is at least `PROPOSAL_VERSION`.

In order to maintain `buyingLiabilities` and `sellingLiabilities` after applying buckets, all effected values must be recalculated. When applying the buckets for a ledger with protocol version less than `PROPOSAL_VERSION`, no work needs to be done as `buyingLiabilities` and `sellingLiabilities` are already `NULL`. When applying the buckets for a ledger with protocol version at least `PROPOSAL_VERSION`, all effected values will need to be recalculated. Initially this can be implemented by recalculating all values, although a more efficient implementation may exist.

### Upgrading the Protocol Version
When the protocol version is upgraded to `PROPOSAL_VERSION`, the values of `buyingLiabilities` and `sellingLiabilities` will need to be calculated for all accounts that own offers. For other accounts these values can either be left as `NULL` and updated lazily, or they can be updated globally to 0.

It is possible, after the protocol version is upgraded to `PROPOSAL_VERSION`, that there are existing offers which are not IEIF. We will now discuss some candidate solutions for how to resolve this issue:

#### Approach 1: Delete all existing offers
As the description suggests, this approach would delete all existing offers when the protocol is upgraded to `PROPOSAL_VERSION`. As of ledger 18178688, there are 12734 offers owned by 2653 accounts (out of 474454 total accounts). One disadvantage to this approach is that it would likely cause a considerable decrease in available liquidity for some time while new offers are created. Some offers which have been created belong to accounts that would not be able to recreate them. There are 5 offers owned by 4 accounts with no signers and a master key weight of 0, with 2 of these offers selling an asset issued by the account. There is 1 other offer owned by an account whose total weight of signers and master key does not exceed the medium threshold, and it is also selling an asset issued by the account. It is worth repeating that this is only a simple lower bound on the number of offers that could not be recreated.

#### Approach 2: Delete offers owned by accounts with excess liabilities
For any account `A` and assets `X` and `Y`, this approach would delete any offer owned by `A` and selling `X` in exchange for `Y` if `A` has excess selling liabilities of `X` or excess buying liabilities of `Y`. As of ledger 18178688, there are a maximum of 6053 offers that would be deleted, owned by a maximum of 983 accounts. One disadvantage to this approach is that it would likely cause a considerable decrease in available liquidity for some time while new offers are created, although this impact would be smaller than in the previous approach. A further disadvantage to this approach is that, for some accounts, some offers may be deleted while others remain which could be undesirable in some cases. Both of these disadvantages could potentially be mitigated by giving an advance notice of a few weeks to the community and developers so that they have time to update their offers such that they do not have excess liabilities. As in the previous approach, it could occur that it is impossible to recreate some offers. But at least offers selling an asset issued by that account are less likely to be deleted, since there is no limit on liabilities for the issuer of an asset. Regarding the specific offers mentioned above, none of the 3 that are selling an asset issued by that account would be deleted.

### Base Reserve
The previous section details only a single point of backward incompatibility, but the process of increasing the base reserve presents a similar issue of backward incompatibility which would be repeatedly possible in the future. The reason for this is that increasing the base reserve could cause offers selling the native asset to no longer be IEIF. The potential solutions presented in the previous section would also apply here, but the same disadvantages would still apply as well.

## Test Cases
* `buyingLiabilities` and `sellingLiabilities` are updated when offers are modified by `PathPaymentOp`, `ManageOfferOp`, `CreatePassiveOfferOp`, and `AllowTrustOp`
* `buyingLiabilities` and `sellingLiabilities` are updated on bucket apply
* Each operation should have the new behavior described above

## Implementation
No implementation yet.
