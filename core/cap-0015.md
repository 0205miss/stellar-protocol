## Simple Summary
This proposal introduces fee-bump transactions, which allow an arbitrary account
to pay the fee for a transaction.

## Motivation
If a transaction has insufficient `fee`, for example due to either surge
pricing or an increase in the `baseFee`, that transaction will not be included
in a transaction set. If the transaction is only signed by the party that wants
to execute it then it is possible to simply craft a new transaction with higher
fee, sign it, and submit it. But there are many circumstances where this is not
possible, such as when pre-signed and pre-authorized transactions are involved.
In these cases, it is possible that a high-value transaction (such as the
release of escrowed funds or the settlement of a payment channel) cannot
execute as of protocol version 11. Fee-bump transactions will resolve this issue
by enabling anyone to pay the fee for an already existing transaction.

The mechanism described here will also facilitate another usage: when applications
(such as games) are willing to pay user fees. As of protocol version 11, this
could be resolved in two ways. In the first approach, funds could be sent
directly to the users' account but there is no guarantee that the user will
spend those funds on fees and there is no way to recover unspent funds. In the
second approach, one or more accounts controlled by the application could be
used as the source account for user transactions but this leads to sequence
number management issues.

Fee-bump transactions as described in this proposal will enable  any account to
pay the fee for an existing transaction without the need to re-sign the existing
transaction or manage sequence numbers.

### Goals Alignment
This proposal is aligned with several Stellar Network Goals, among them:

- The Stellar Network should facilitate simplicity and interoperability with other protocols and
  networks.
- The Stellar Network should make it easy for developers of Stellar projects to create highly
  usable products.

## Abstract
`TransactionEnvelope` is transformed from an XDR `struct` to an XDR `union`
while preserving binary compatibility. `FeeBumpTransaction` is introduced as a
new type of transaction with corresponding envelope type `ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP`.

## Specification

### XDR
The new transaction, transaction envelope, and related XDR types are:
```c++
enum EnvelopeType
{
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX_V0 = 0,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_SCP = 1,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX = 2,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_AUTH = 3,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_SCPVALUE = 4,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP = 5
};

struct TransactionV0
{
    uint256 sourceAccountEd25519;
    uint32 fee;
    SequenceNumber seqNum;
    TimeBounds* timeBounds;
    Memo memo;
    Operation operations<100>;
    union switch (int v) {
    case 0:
        void;
    } ext;
};

struct DecoratedTransactionV0
{
    TransactionV0 tx;
    /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
     * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
    DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
};

struct FeeBumpTransaction
{
    AccountID feeSource;
    uint64 fee;
    TimeBounds *timeBounds;
    union switch (EnvelopeType type)
    {
    case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX_V0:
        DecoratedTransactionV0 v0;
    } innerTx;
};

struct DecoratedFeeBumpTransaction
{
    FeeBumpTransaction tx;
    /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
     * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
    DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
};

union TransactionEnvelope switch (EnvelopeType type) {
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX_V0:
    DecoratedTransactionV0 v0;
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP:
    DecoratedFeeBumpTransaction feeBump;
};

struct TransactionSignaturePayload
{
    Hash networkId;
    union switch (EnvelopeType type)
    {
    // Backwards Compatibility: Use ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX to sign ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX_V0
    case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX:
        Transaction tx;
    case ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP:
        FeeBumpTransaction feeBump;
    }
    taggedTransaction;
};
```

The new transaction result XDR types are:
```c++
enum TransactionResultCode
{
    txFEE_BUMPED = 1,
    // .... txSUCCESS, ..., txINTERNAL_ERROR unchanged ....
    txNOT_NORMALIZED = -12,      // signatures are not sorted
    txNOT_SUPPORTED = -13,       // transaction type not supported
    txINNER_TX_INVALID = -14     // fee bump inner transaction invalid, never
                                 // returned during apply
};

struct InnerTransactionResult
{
    int64 feeCharged;

    union switch (TransactionResultCode code)
    {
    // txFEE_BUMPED is not included
    case txSUCCESS:
    case txFAILED:
        OperationResult results<>;
    case txTOO_EARLY:
    case txTOO_LATE:
    case txMISSING_OPERATION:
    case txBAD_SEQ:
    case txBAD_AUTH:
    case txINSUFFICIENT_BALANCE:
    case txNO_ACCOUNT:
    case txINSUFFICIENT_FEE:
    case txBAD_AUTH_EXTRA:
    case txINTERNAL_ERROR:
    case txNOT_NORMALIZED:
    case txNOT_SUPPORTED:
    // txINNER_TX_INVALID is not included
        void;
    }
    result;

    // reserved for future use
    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }
    ext;
};

struct TransactionResult
{
    int64 feeCharged; // actual fee charged for the transaction

    union switch (TransactionResultCode code)
    {
    case txSUCCESS:
    case txFAILED:
        OperationResult results<>;
    case txINNER_TX_INVALID:
        InnerTransactionResult innerResult;
    default:
        void;
    }
    result;

    // reserved for future use
    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    }
    ext;
};
```

### Semantics
For this subsection, let E be a transaction envelope with
`E.type() == ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP`.

If F is a transaction envelope then

- `Inner(F) = F.v0()` and `Outer(F) = F.v0()` if
`F.type() == ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX_V0`
- `Inner(F) = F.feeBump().innerTx.v0()` and `Outer(F) = F.feeBump()` if
`F.type() == ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP`

The slot for a transaction envelope F is the tuple
`(Inner(F).tx.sourceAccount, Inner(F).tx.seqNum)`.

#### Normalization
We say that a transaction envelope F is normalized if `Outer(F).signatures`
and `Inner(F).signatures` are both sorted in ascending order according to the
relation:
`A < B` if `A.hint < B.hint || (A.hint == B.hint && A.signature < B.signature)`
for any decorated signatures A and B. E is invalid if it is not normalized.

#### Validity
`Inner(E).fee` must be non-negative. It does not need to exceed the minimum fee
because the fee is specified by `Outer(E).fee`. There are no requirements on the
balance of `Inner(E).sourceAccount` because the fee will be paid by
`Outer(E).feeSource`. Other than these two exceptions, `Inner(E)` must be valid
independent of E.

`Outer(E).fee` must exceed the minimum fee of `Inner(E)` by at least one base fee.
Furthermore, the effective fee of `Outer(E)` must exceed the effective fee of
`Inner(E)`. Specifically, `Outer(E).fee / [Inner(E).operations.size() + 1]` must
exceed `Inner(E).fee / Inner(e).operations.size()`. `Outer(E).feeSource` needs
sufficient available balance (accounting for reserve and native selling
liabilities) to pay `Outer(E).fee`.

If `Outer(E).timeBounds` is specified then

- E is too early if `Outer(E).timeBounds.minTime` exceeds the ledger close time
- E is too late if `Outer(E).timeBounds.maxTime != 0` and the ledger close time
exceeds `Outer(E).timeBounds.maxTime`

`Outer(E).signatures` must contain signatures satisfying the low threshold of
the `feeSource` account. To be explicit, signatures in `Outer(E).signatures` only
provide signing weight to E whereas signatures in `Inner(E).signatures` only
provide signing weight to `Inner(E)`.

#### Surge Pricing
The effective fee of E is equal to `Outer(E).fee / [Inner(E).tx.operations.size() + 1]`.
This would be the effective fee of `Inner(E)` if it had one additional operation.

When constructing a transaction set, E will be in the transaction queue for
`Inner(E).sourceAccount`. This ensures that sequence number ordering will be
respected.

If E1, ..., En is the set of valid transaction envelopes with a given slot, then
when any of them has been included in the transaction set the rest must be
removed from the transaction queue. They will be placed into a separate priority
queue that tracks all transaction envelopes that no longer have any impact on
sequence number ordering. This makes it possible to include transactions with
both higher sequence numbers and higher fees before adding additional transactions
with lower sequence numbers and lower fees.

If E and `Inner(E)` are both in the transaction queue and E is included in the
transaction set, then `Inner(E)` will necessarily be included as well. This makes
sense because it costs no additional operations to add `Inner(E)`, but will add
additional fees.

When adding a new transaction envelope to the transaction set, it will be the
transaction envelope with the highest fee among the tops of the two priority
queues.

#### Applying
If E1, ..., En is the set of transaction envelopes with a given slot that are in
the transaction set, then `Inner(E1) == ... == Inner(En)`. Either `Ek = Inner(E1)`
for exactly one k in `{1, ..., n}`, or it should be added to the transaction set
as E(n+1). In either case, `Inner(E1)` will be applied exactly once and all
other transaction envelopes with the same slot will return `txFEE_BUMPED`.

#### Transaction Results
This proposal introduces several new possibilities for `TransactionResultCode`:

- `txFEE_BUMPED` indicates that a `FeeBumpTransaction` was applied (this will be
returned even if the `FeeBumpTransaction` is no longer valid, for example if it
were not properly authorized, by the time it is reached in the transaction apply
order)
- `txNOT_NORMALIZED` indicates that `DecoratedTransactionV0` or
`DecoratedFeeBumpTransaction` had `signatures` that were not properly sorted
- `txNOT_SUPPORTED` indicates that the `TransactionEnvelope` is not supported
in the current protocol version. As of this proposal, this will only occur if a
`TransactionEnvelope` with `type == ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP` is submitted before
the version upgrade occurs
- `txINNER_TX_INVALID` indicates that a `FeeBumpTransaction` was submitted but
the `innerTx` was invalid. The result will contain a `InnerTransactionResult`,
which can contain any result other than `txFEE_BUMPED` and `txINNER_TX_INVALID`.
This result can only be returned during validation

## Rationale

### Replay Prevention
`FeeBumpTransaction` does not contain an explicit sequence number because it
relies on the sequence number of the inner transaction for replay prevention.

### Fees
The semantics specify that a fee-bump transaction is invalid if the effective fee
of the outer transaction does not exceed the effective fee of the inner transaction.
This restriction is designed to prevent an obvious misunderstanding of the
semantics of `FeeBumpTransaction`. Suppose someone has a signed transaction with
fee `F`, but they actually do not want to pay a fee greater than `F' < F`. Then
they use a `FeeBumpTransaction` with the outer fee set to `F'`. But if the
`FeeBumpTransaction` can be included in the transaction set, then the inner
transaction also could be included in the transaction set because it has a higher
fee. This completely defeats the purpose of submitting the `FeeBumpTransaction`
with fee `F' < F`, so we prohibit this possibility entirely.

### Normalization
As of protocol 11, it is not possible for a transaction set to contain multiple
transactions with the same slot. This will change with the introduction of fee
bump transactions. Still no single transaction should be included in a transaction
set more than once and only one transaction with a given slot can be applied.
In order to resolve these issues with minimal burden on the implementor, we
propose that a transaction envelope is invalid if it is not normalized.

## Backwards Incompatibilities
All downstream systems which submit transactions to stellar-core will need to
normalize transactions before submission. As a temporary bridge, stellar-core
will normalize submitted transactions. But this bridge will not work for the
newly introduced `FeeBumpTransactions`, which will need explicit support for
transaction normalization in downstream systems.
