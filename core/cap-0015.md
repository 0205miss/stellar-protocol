## Simple Summary

This CAP introduces the concept of the "Bump Fee Extension" (BFE) to 
allow paying transaction fees by arbitrary account.

## Abstract

There are a few cases that require charging transaction fees to the account 
balance other than `source` account:

- Games, exchanges, and other applications willing to pay user fees. 
- Pre-signed transactions in case of the `base_fee` increase.
- Coordinated multi-sig transactions with insufficient fees. 
- Fee optimization services that can ensure transactions execution in fee 
racing conditions.

This CAP introduces the way for paying fees for any transaction by extending 
TransactionEnvelope XDR.

## Motivation

The problem of paying fees for another account has been discussed multiple 
times. Current solutions are based on multi-sig with source account 
replacement or direct [fees "refund"](
https://www.lumenauts.com/blog/better-stellar-fee-channels) for user accounts. 
However, both approaches are not ideal and require multi-sig coordination. 
With the proposed transaction envelope extension users can sign and submit 
transactions to the application server endpoint which automatically modifies 
the envelope to allow paying fees from another account. 

In the case of `base_fee` protocol parameter increase, long-lived preauthorized 
transactions may become invalid because of insufficient fees. Currently, we 
have no mechanism that would allow changing fees for such transactions, or 
"pushing" them to the ledger in any other way. 


## Specification

Introduce a new kind of transaction called a FeeBump, which actually
results in two different transactions executing.

enum EnvelopeType
{
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX0 = 0,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_SCP = 1,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX = 2,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_AUTH = 3,
    ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP = 4  // new
};

struct FeeBumpTransaction {
    AccountID feeSource;
    uint64 fee;
    union switch (EnvelopeType type) {
    case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX:
        struct {
            Transaction tx;
            /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
             * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
            DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
        } v1;
    } innerTx;
}

struct TransactionSignaturePayload
{
    Hash networkId;
    union switch (EnvelopeType type)
    {
    case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX:
        Transaction tx;
    case ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP:
        Transaction4 feeBumpTx;
    }
    taggedTransaction;
};

/* A TransactionEnvelope wraps a transaction with signatures. */
union TransactionEnvelope switch (EnvelopeType type) {
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX0:
    struct {
        Transaction0 tx;
        /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
         * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
        DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
    } v0;
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_TX:
    struct {
        Transaction tx;
        /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
         * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
        DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
    } v1;
case ENVELOPE_TYPE_FEE_BUMP:
    struct {
        FeeBumpTransaction tx;
        /* Each decorated signature is a signature over the SHA256 hash of
         * a TransactionSignaturePayload */
        DecoratedSignature signatures<20>;
    } feeBump;
};
~~~~

To confirm the intention to pay fees for the specific transaction on
behalf of the sponsor account, `signatures` should contain signatures
satisfying the `low_threshold` of the `feeSource` account.  These
signatures do not contribute to the signing weight of `innerTx`--only
`innerTx.signatures` contributes to the inner transaction.  Similarly,
the signatures in the `TransactionEnvelope` do not contribute to
signing weight for `innerTx`, which must be valid on its own (modulo
the fee).

When a FeeBump transaction executes, it actually causes two different
transactions with two different transaction IDs and sets of effects.

The fee charging logic for FeeBump transactions follows general
[CAP-0005](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0005.md)
convention.  For the envelopes with bump fee logic, validators should
increase the `minfee` by the `base_fee` amount to prevent intentional
BFE spamming.  Envelops with `fee` amount lower than the previous
highest fee offered plus `base_fee` are to be discarded.  If fees
charged are less than fees offered, the `feeSource` account is drained
(up to `fee`) before any fee is deducted from the `sourceAccount` of
`innerTx`.

## Rationale

The proposed solution requires minimum protocol changes and covers a wide 
range of potential use-cases leaving a room for the possible future 
modifications. It also resolves the problem of long-lived preauthorized 
transactions. 

Transaction envelops with bump fee extension follow the standard lifecycle, 
do not require new operations or fundamental changes in ledger entities. 
Fees for any transaction envelope can be set at any time and resubmitted 
more than once, for example, in case if the `fee` amount was not enough.

The transaction fee can be updated implicitly, without any interaction 
with a user, which provides a consistent user experience. At the same time, 
the `feeSource` account retains full control and is able to refuse sponsoring 
fees in any particular situation.
