## Simple Summary

This CAP introduces the concept of the "Bump Fee Transaction" (BFT) to 
allow paying transaction fees by arbitrary account.

## Abstract

There are a few cases that require charging transaction fees from the account 
balance other than `source` account:

- Games, exchanges, and other applications willing to pay user fees. 
- Pre-signed transactions in case of the `base_fee` increase.
- Coordinated multi-sig transactions with insufficient fees. 
- Fee optimization services that can ensure transactions execution in fee 
racing conditions.

This CAP introduces BFT transactions by adding `replace_fee_tx` field to the 
Transaction XDR. 

## Motivation

The problem of paying fees for another account has been discussed multiple 
times. Current solutions are based on multi-sig with source account 
replacement or direct [fees "refund"](
https://www.lumenauts.com/blog/better-stellar-fee-channels) for user accounts. 
However, both approaches are not ideal and require multi-sig coordination. 
With BFT transactions users can sign and submit transactions to the 
application server endpoint which automatically creates and submits 
corresponding BFT transactions. 

In the case of `base_fee` protocol parameter increase, long-lived preauthorized 
transactions may become invalid because of insufficient fees. Currently, we 
have no mechanism that would allow changing fees for such transactions, or 
"pushing" them to the ledger in any other way. 


## Specification

We extend the Transaction XDR with a `replace_fee_tx` field which represents 
the hash of the transaction for which fees should be replaced.

```c++
struct Transaction
{
    // ...
    union switch (int v)
    {
    case 0:
        void;
    case 1:
        struct
        { 
            Hash replace_fee_tx;          
            union switch (int v)
            {
                case 0:
                    void;
            } ext;
        } v1;
    }
};
```

Both transactions (BFT and original) have to be submitted to the Network 
simultaneously and included in the same ledger. 

Whenever the validator receives a BFT transaction, it looks for the original 
transaction by the hash specified in the `replace_fee_tx` field of the BFT 
transaction and adds the BFT `fee` amount to the original transaction 
`fee` bid. 

- If the required fee amount is higher than the `fee` of the original 
transaction, the `fee` amount is charged on the original transaction 
`source` account, and any excess is charged against the BFT `source` account.
- If the original transaction has a `fee` set to zero, the entire amount of 
required fees should be charged on the `source` account of BFT transaction.
- If the original transaction `fee` is sufficient, the BFT transaction should 
be discarded with `tx_excessive_fee` message without BFT `source` sequence 
bump. 
- If `original fee + BFT fee` is less than required min fee, both 
transactions should fail with message code `tx_insufficient_fee`.
- If the original transaction was not found by hash, the BFT transaction 
should be rejected with message code `tx_original_transaction_not_found`.
- BFT transaction that bumps fees for another BFT transaction should be 
rejected with message code `tx_original_transaction_not_found`.

## Rationale

The proposed solution requires minimum protocol changes and covers a wide 
range of potential use-cases leaving a room for the possible future 
modifications. It also resolves the problem of long-lived preauthorized 
transactions. 

BFT transactions follow the standard lifecycle, therefore they preserve all 
smart contract capabilities including sequence checks, multi-sig for the 
source account, and time-locking. 

## Discussion

- Is there any reliable way to send both transactions to Horizon 
simultaneously?  
Maybe we could make use of XdrStream similar to the history archives 
serialization format to send more than one transaction in a single HTTP 
request? 
- Should we use a new type of Operation instead of extending the Transaction 
object? Both options have cons and pros.
- How we should treat multiple BFT transactions pointing to the same original 
transaction? Ideally all of them should participate in the fee bidding for the 
original transaction summing up all BFT tx fees, but it looks quite complex. 
Maybe validators should consider only the first BFT transaction. 
- What if BFT transaction contains any additional operations? 
- Should we charge `base_fee` for the BFT transaction itself? 
- How BFT transactions correlate with `max_tx_set_size`? Wide usage of such 
BFT transaction may result in reduced actual tx set size. 
- Using BFT transactions may lead to the increase CPU loading for validators.
