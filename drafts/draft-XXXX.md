## Simple Summary
"IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open." - [IPFS (README.md)](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs#overview)

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
Should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the SEP solves. SEP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Compatibility
All SEPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The SEP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. SEP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SEPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other SEPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation
The implementations must be completed before any SEPs is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the SEP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
